## Personal Router Configuration

Getting ipv6 and radvd is still a huge pain on Linux.

Rather than debug it for the nth time, I just ported the excellent code from https://github.com/rtr7/router7 into a form that was easy to just ssh and run on my router machine.

I'll continue to add features to it. My thinking is that there won't be a config file or anything, it will just be compiled with the specific configuration I need. If you want this to, you can do the same! Or you can add a config file!

Enjoy! And thanks to https://github.com/stapelberg for the wonderful router7 code!
